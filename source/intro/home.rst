Background
**********

Cloud Seven Consultants (CSC) has been contracted by ATAMO (the client) to investigate energy management in low-power wireless sensor networks (WSN). The project requires integration of a third party WSN with an ATAMO Arduino based development platform. Sensor data (e.g. temperature, vibration) must be measured and periodically reported over the wireless network to a cloud-based database. The firmware in the sensor must provide for reliable communications while keeping tight constraints on battery energy usage. This information must be accessible on the web via a graphical user interface (GUI).
